See full details below.\nSpeaker James Tripp, Senior Research Software Engineer, Information and Digital Group, University of Warwick\nAbstract Docker is a container technology which allows you to specify and build a compute environment. You can run the environment on your local machine and both the instructions for creating the environment and the environment itself can be shared. In this talk I will (a) introduce containers, (b) discuss a worked examples of using Docker with R, and (c) consider how containers can help us do better research. Hopefully this presentation will help those of you who have never used Docker to consider if you want to use Docker in your own work and where to start."

    "text": "Take a look at the movie SpaceJam on IMDB. We want to collect its reviews.\nWe will first use the popular package rvest for scraping. We will load the package as well as dplyr for some additional data manipulation functions.\n\nlibrary(rvest)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nHow do we go about scraping the reviews? Manually inspecting the site, we found where they are: [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117705/reviews]. We read this page into R. To do that, we need to tell R its URL which we first save into the new object url. Next, we parse the web page. We use the function read_html().\n\nurl &lt;- \"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117705/reviews\"\nspacejamrevhtml &lt;- read_html(url)\n\nspacejamrevhtml is a list containing the entire document, including the HTML formatting. If you do not anything about HTML, W3Schools is a great resource for learning it.\n\n\nFor web-scraping, we make use of the fact that web pages follow a standardised structure. We can tell R exactly which element of this structure we want to collect.\nWeb pages have a head and a body. HTML documents consist of a tree of elements and text. Inside the body of a HTML page, tags can specify the elements to be displayed. Examples:\n&lt;h1&gt;This is a heading.&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this is the next.&lt;/p&gt;\nIn addition, HTML attributes can provide additional information about HTML elements. Attributes are included in the starting tag and come as name-value-pairs (attributename=“attributevalue”). We often need to use attributes to specify what exactly we want to scrape. An example of an attribute are classes. They specify a class for an HTML element. Multiple HTML elements can share the same class. We often encounter classes because they are frequently used for consistent formatting of similar content.\nExample: &lt;p class=\"definitions\"&gt;This is the text within the p of class definitions.&lt;/p&gt;\nFor an overview of further attributes, check W3Schools.\nHow can we specify the tags and attributes of the information we are interested in? We use CSS selectors. CSS selectors are pattern matching rules which are originally used to determine which style and formatting rules apply to which elements.\nExamples: p refers to all paragraphs on a website. .definitions refers to all elements with the class definitions on a website.\nTo learn more about CSS selectors, check W3Schools.\nWe can find the relevant element tags and attributes through our browser, by looking at the HTML source code of any website and by inspecting specific elements. There are also tools to make our life easier like SelectorGadget (check out its webpage)."

    "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic changed the way people lived, worked, and studied around the world, with direct consequences for domestic energy use. In this talk I present our study which assessed the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns in the first two years of the pandemic on household electricity and gas use in England and Wales. I explain how I used R for the machine learning and how I made the figures (see .Rmd file for figure code).\nUsing data for 508 (electricity) and 326 (gas) homes, elastic net regression, neural network and extreme gradient boosting predictive models were trained and tested on pre-pandemic data. The most accurate model for each household was used to create counterfactuals (predictions in the absence of COVID-19) against which observed pandemic energy use was compared. Our analysis showed that on average (electricity; gas) consumption increased by (7.8%; 5.7%) in year 1 of the pandemic and by (2.2%; 0.2%) in year 2. The greatest increases were in the winter lockdown (January – March 2021) by 11.6% and 9.0% for electricity and gas, respectively. At the start of 2022 electricity use remained 2.0% higher while gas use was around 1.9% lower than predicted. Households with children showed the greatest increase in electricity consumption during lockdowns, followed by those with adults in work. Wealthier households increased their electricity consumption by more than the less wealthy and continued to use more than predicted throughout the two-year period while the less wealthy returned to pre-pandemic or lower consumption from summer 2021. Low dwelling efficiency was associated with a greater increase in energy consumption during the pandemic. Additionally, this study shows the value of different machine learning techniques for counterfactual modelling at the individual-dwelling level, and our approach can be used to robustly estimate the impact of other events and interventions."

    "text": "Speaker: Nicole Schwitter, PhD student, Department of Sociology, University of Warwick\nAbstract: The rise of the internet and mass digitalisation have led to vast amounts of digital data in recent years. These novel digital sources of data are used to gain new insights into old and new questions of data-driven sciences: From election results to press releases, social media posts or user reviews, research now often makes use of data that is online. Many modern commercial websites await user input and/or display dynamic web content which is generated on the fly via JavaScript technologies. Standard techniques of web-scraping which are well-suited to collect information from static pages will fail in these instances. In such cases, it is necessary to automate the browser to visit websites, click buttons, and fill in forms by itself - a task the tool Selenium fulfils. This talk will give a brief overview of approaches towards web scraping and an introduction to the R package RSelenium. The presentation will highlight use cases of RSelenium, show its potential, and give a starting point to those who have never used it."
