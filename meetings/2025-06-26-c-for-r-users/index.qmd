## Overview

Much of base R is written in C. As R users, we may encounter this code when debugging our own code. As R contributors, we may wish to propose patches to the C code if we discover a bug. In any case, learning a new language can be fun and rewarding!

In this talk, I'll discuss why, as R users/programmers, we may want to learn C, and resources for doing so. I'll show examples of how C is used in the codebase of base R. I'll give an example of how, with only a little C knowledge, it was possible to add a new feature into the language (specifying colours with three-digit hex codes). Finally, Iâ€™ll discuss various initiatives from the R Contribution Working Group and show how you, too, can get involved in contributing to base R.

## About the speaker

Ella is a Research Software Engineer at the University of Warwick, UK, and a Fellow of the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://software.ac.uk). She works to increase sustainability and EDI (Equality, Diversity and Inclusion) in the R Project, in particular by fostering a larger and more diverse community of contributors to base R. She also runs [rainbowR](https://rainbowr.org), a community that connects, supports, and promotes LGBTQ+ people who code in R, and spreads awareness of LGBTQ+ issues through data-driven activism.
