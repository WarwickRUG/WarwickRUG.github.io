This meet-up featured four talks!

## Ella Kaye (Statistics, Warwick) *Warwick-branded plots, presentations and websites using Quarto and R*

In this talk, Ella presents three related projects:

- **warwickplots**: An R package with colour palettes and a ggplot2 theme
  
- **warwickpres**: A Quarto Revealjs extension for presentations

- **warwickcourse**: A GitHub template for creating course/workshop websites with Quarto

She lets people know they exist and what they look like. She gives a quick guide and demo on getting started using them and lets people know where to learn more. Most of all, she encourages people to use them!

### Resources

- [slides](resources/Does-advertising-work.pptx)
- [DataCove](https://datacove.co.uk)

### About the speaker

I am the founder of Datacove; your Data and analytics partner, specialising in customer analytics (unearthing your most valuable customers), marketing analytics (to maximise campaign performance) and process automation (automating your most time commanding tasks). I have 20 years of industry experience across a wide range of business sectors including charity, cyber security, fashion, financial services, FMCG, government, hospitality, legal, leisure and travel.

I'm an advanced user of the R programming language, so much so that people often call me "Mr R" and (in combination with my love of public speaking) I currently run R community user groups across the UK in Brighton, Bristol, Birmingham, London, Manchester and Portsmouth as well as organising EARL, the UK's biggest R & Python conference, which takes place over three days in September. Previous to running EARL, I have also spoken at the conference on five occasions in 2016, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2022.

### About the speaker

I am a versatile, transdisciplinary and passionate person with a mixed technical and sociological background: I’ve worked as an architect, drupal developer, project manager, lecturer, researcher and as a data scientist, doing data munging and visualization using R and dealing with geospatial data using QGIS.

My multiple research interests are framed within the Urban Studies, and more specifically around the commodifications between cities, technology and society. So far, I have focused on the topic of social and spatial inequities to find ways in which cities can be more sustainable and egalitarian, hence improving people’s well-being.

## Luke Ouma (AstraZeneca) *Simulation studies in R: A case of developing novel/efficient methods for clinical trial design.*

### Resources

- [slides](resources/clinical-trials.pdf)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/oondijo/multipleBiomarkers)

### About the speaker

Luke is a Medical statistician with experience in design of studies and analysis of data in different therapeutic areas. His research largely focuses on the development of novel Bayesian methods to improve the design and analysis of precision medicine trials—mainly Master protocols (umbrella, basket, and platform trials). Beyond this, he is keen on linking up with fellow researchers aiming to leverage the power of data to improve decision-making in health and care particularly in SSA, and developing the capacity of young statisticians through training (Msc, PhD, postdocs ).
