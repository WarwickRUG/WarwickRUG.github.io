At the end of our [previous presentation by Iain Emsley on code review](/posts/2022-05-17-code-review/) we had an interesting discussion on the need for reproducibility. This talk introduces the concept of reproducibility and focuses on one of it's many facets: that of managing R script's dependencies.

In order to do so, two different methods will be presented, compared and discussed: the simple yet works-out-of-the-box [{automagic}](https://github.com/cole-brokamp/automagic) and the more complex, yet backed up by RStudio, [{renv}](https://github.com/rstudio/renv/)

At the end of the session, points in common as well as limitations will be highlighted, hopefully leading to a discussion and opening the door for the second talk of the reproducibility series.
