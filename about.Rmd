description: |
  Warwick R-user group is for everybody interested in R, the programming language for statistical computing, data science, visualisation and reproducible reporting.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
source(file.path("R", "functions.R"))
```

Warwick R User Group meets every 2 months to discuss R-related topics. At each session, speakers present interesting R packages (and how to make your own), share tips and tricks and offer advice to new R users.

Everyone is welcome, regardless of R programming experience, from across or outside Warwick University. For further information, visit our Meetup.com page or contact a member of the [WRUG committee](about#committee).
