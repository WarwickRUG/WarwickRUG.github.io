Warwick R-user group is for everybody interested in R, the programming language for statistical computing, data science, visualisation and reproducible reporting.

Warwick R User Group meets every 2 months to discuss R-related topics. At each session, speakers present interesting R packages (and how to make your own), share tips and tricks and offer advice to new R users.

Everyone is welcome, regardless of R programming experience, from across or outside Warwick University. For further information, visit our [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/WarwickRUG) page or contact a member of the [WRUG committee](about#committee).
