Warwick R-user group is for everybody interested in R, the programming language for statistical computing, data science, visualisation and reproducible reporting. Whether you are just learning R for the first time or are an expert R user, all are welcome

Warwick R User Group meets every 2â€“4 weeks to discuss R-related topics. At each session, speakers present interesting R packages (and how to make your own), share tips and tricks and offer advice to new R users.

Everyone is welcome, from across or outside the university and regardless of R programming experience. For further information, visit our Meetup.com page or e-mail Heather Graham or James Tripp.
