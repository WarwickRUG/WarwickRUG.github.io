This talk will feature Chris Mainey discussing the use of ‘Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)’ to fit regression models to ‘wiggly’ or non-linear data. Sometimes the relationships we are interested in are not a simple straight-line. Polynomial terms and combining them to for ‘splines’ will be introduced and then used in GAMs. This will be demonstrated in R as part of the talk. This will be an exciting talk for those wanting to deepen their knowledge of regression.

For in-person attendees, the talk will be followed by pizza/salad and soft drinks, thanks to our sponsors: the [R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/).
