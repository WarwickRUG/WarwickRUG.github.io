This meet-up featured four talks!

## Ella Kaye (Statistics, Warwick) *Warwick-branded plots, presentations and websites using Quarto and R*

In this talk, Ella presents three related projects:

- **warwickplots**: An R package with colour palettes and a ggplot2 theme
  
- **warwickpres**(https://github.com/Warwick-Stats-Resources/warwickpres): A Quarto Revealjs extension for presentations

- **warwickcourse**(https://github.com/Warwick-Stats-Resources/warwickcourse): A GitHub template for creating course/workshop websites with Quarto

She lets people know they exist and what they look like. She gives a quick guide and demo on getting started using them and lets people know where to learn more. Most of all, she encourages people to use them!

### About the speaker

I am a versatile, transdisciplinary and passionate person with a mixed technical and sociological background: I’ve worked as an architect, drupal developer, project manager, lecturer, researcher and as a data scientist, doing data munging and visualization using R and dealing with geospatial data using QGIS.

My multiple research interests are framed within the Urban Studies, and more specifically around the commodifications between cities, technology and society. So far, I have focused on the topic of social and spatial inequities to find ways in which cities can be more sustainable and egalitarian, hence improving people’s well-being.

## Luke Ouma (AstraZeneca) *Simulation studies in R: A case of developing novel/efficient methods for clinical trial design.*
