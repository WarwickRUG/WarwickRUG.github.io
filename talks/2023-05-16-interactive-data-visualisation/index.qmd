In this talk I introduce {htmlwidgets} - the collection of packages you wish you knew. With these packages you can create interactive charts, graphs, tables and maps all in R without needing to learn any JavaScript.

On top of {htmlwidgets}, I will also demonstrate the fundamentals of using {shiny} to build server applications all with R - and show how to combine these with {htmlwidgets} to build impressive and beautiful tools.

I have a background in reproducible research methodologies, so I will talk about how you can use these tools to create an end-to-end reproducible Open Data workflow. The same workflow used by the University of Oxford's Interactive Data Network that I helped launch.
